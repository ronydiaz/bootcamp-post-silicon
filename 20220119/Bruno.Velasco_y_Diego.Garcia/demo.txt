When you grow up your heart dies
Who cares?
I care
When you grow up your heart dies (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Just keep holding that secret code by your side
Somebody call, somebody call it (don't go)
Don't let it go, don't let it go (just stay)
Without somebody to hold, without somebody (ooh)
I just need that body (ooh)
You're on fire
The way you dance with the devil tonight
You're on fire
You got that last dance look in your eyes
Just like a movie
Don't let your heart die
Don't let your heart die
Don't let your heart die
Hey temptation, escape with me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Just some flashing lights and some tire smoke is all that we need
Somebody call, somebody call it (don't go)
Don't let it go, don't let it go (just stay)
Without somebody to hold, without somebody (ooh)
I just need that body (ooh)
You're on fire
The way you dance with the devil tonight
You're on fire
You got that last dance look in your eyes
Just like a movie
Don't let your heart die
Don't let your heart die
Don't let your heart die
You're on fire
Just like a movie
A suicide of a perfect mind
Promise, don't let your heart die
Whatever will be, will be
Don't care what anyone else thinks
You'll be okay, I promise
Just keep on keeping on
It's just a bad day, not a bad life
I'll always be there for you
I swear the breath from my lungs
You'll feel it when you know
Life is worth the risk
Live long and prosper
Believe in yourself and create your own destiny
Don't fear failure
Keep running on
Just hold on
Just fight on
Until the sun goes down
Just remember when you grow up your heart dies
Don't ever give up
Everything worth doing is hard
The only time that matters is right now
It's okay to feel lost
Live life to the full because you never know what's around the corner
So let's take a part of the world and make it our own
Don't let the bastards grind you down
You saved me
Keep running on
Just hold on
Just fight on
Until the sun goes down
Just remember when you grow up your heart dies
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves
We always have each other
Keep your head up, kid
Always fear regret more than failure
Stay true to yourself
There is still good in the world
Expect nothing and appreciate everything
It was all worth it
The sun never sets on your dreams
